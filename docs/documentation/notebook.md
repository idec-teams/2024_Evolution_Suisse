# Lab notebook

## May
+ Lab introduction
+ Cloning first level 0 (pES0001-pES0022) and level 1 constructs (pES1001-pES1027)
+ Cloning of the SP plasmids coding for SIAH1 and SIAH2
+ Set up the first PACE reactor to evolve base editor TadA, based on a previous work by Richter _et al._[^1]

## June
+ Cloning most level 1 (pES1028-pES1070) and first level 2 constructs (pES2001-pES2011)
+ Production of phages bearing different SP plasmids coding for SIAH1 and SIAH2
+ Troubleshooting of the PACE reactor setup and code

## July
+ Cloning of level 1 (pES1067-pES1103), and level 2 constructs (pES2012-pES2022), among which:
  + Side-directed mutagenesis of EGLN3 to disrupt the degron motif
+ Co-transformation of pES1076+pES2008 (containing EGLN3 as a substrate) into S2060 cells
+ First propagation assay comparing SIAH1-SP, SIAH2-SP, and UN-SP
+ Set up PACE for evolution of SIAH1 using S2060 cells co-transformed with pES1076+PES2008
+ Troubleshooting of the PACE reactor setup and code

## August
+Cloning of level 1 (pES1104-pES1111) and level 2 (pES2023-pES2037) constructs, among which:
  + Level 2 constructs with degron-mutated EGLN3 variants
  + Level 2 construct without N-term RNAP
+ While SIAH1-SP phages do not wash out from the PACE lagoon, subsequent phage propagation assays show non-specific propagation ability, so the evolution is put on hold
+ Co-transformation of pES1035+pES2009 (containing α-Synuclein as a substrate) and pES1033+pES2009 (containing EGLN3 as a substrate) into S2060 cells
+ Co-transformation of degron-mutated EGLN3 variants (pES1076, pES1097, pES1098, pES1101, pES1102) with pES2008 into S2060 cells
+ Phage propagation assay with EGLN3 and α-Synuclein as substrates
+ Phage propagation assay with degron-mutated EGLN3 variants
+ Phage propagation assay for different sizes of the SP
+ Set up PACE for drift of SIAH1-SP using S2060-DP6 strain
+ As the PACE reactor needs further troubleshooting, paralelly set up PANCE for drift of SIAH1-SP using S2060-DP6 strain

## September
+ Cloning of level 0 (pES0023-pES0028), level 1 (pES1112-pES1158) and level 2 (pES2038-pES2074) constructs, among which:
  + Constructs with NLRP3 as a substrate
  + Constructs with different promoter potencies controlling expression of E1 and E2
  + Constructs containing the pVan + VanR inducible system controlling expression of RNAP subunits
  + Constructs containing the psp promoter controlling expression of RNAP subunits
  + Level 2 constructs with SmR (spectinomycin resistance cassette)
  + Level 2 constructs with different linkers for the N-term RNAP subunit - Ubiquitin fusion
+ Troubleshooting of cloning system using both Golden Gate and Gibson assembly protocols, including:
  + Adaptation of the termocycler protocol for Golden Gate assembly
  + Changing the resistance cassette for level 2 constructions to SmR
+ Production of a knockout SIAH1 SP plasmid (SIAH1-KO) to validate our system
+ Co-transformation of pES1076+pES2037 (no N-term RNAP system) and transformation of pES2008 only (no C-term RNAP system) in S2060 cells
+ Phage propagation assay in cells without either the N-term or the C-term RNAP subunit
+ Phage propagation assay for vanillic acid-inducible system validation
+ Assay to confirm that vanillic acid and other components of the system (e.g., RNAP subunits) are not toxic for cell growth

## October
+ PANCE for different S2060 co-transformant strains using SIAH1-SP
