## Golden Gate Cloning
Golden Gate constructs were assembled using the EcoFlex MoClo kit[^1] (Addgene kit #1000000080). This kit comes with level 0,1, and 2 backbones (see publication for more details).

1. Add the following to a PCR tube (use BsaI for level 1 and BsmBI for level 2 assemblies):

| Reagent  | Amount |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Backbone DNA  | 50 ng  |
| Insert DNA  | 100 ng |
| 10 × T4 DNA ligase buffer | 1 μl |
| T4 ligase  | 0.5 μl |
| BsaI / BsmBI  | 0.5 μl |
| ddH2O  | fill up to 10 μl |

2. Incubate in the thermocycler using the following protocol:
 
Level 1 / BsaI

| Step  | Nr. of Cycles | Temperature (ºC)|Time|
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Digestion and ligation | 15-30  |37  |10 min  |
| Annealing | 15-30  | 16  |5 min  |
| Final digestion and T4 ligase inactivation | 1  |50 |5 min  |
| Enzyme inactivation | 1   |80 |5 min  |

 
Level 2 / BsmBI

| Step  | Nr. of Cycles | Temperature (ºC)|Time|
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Initial digestion | 1  |42  |1 h  |
| Digestion and ligation | 99  |42  |5 min  |
| Annealing | 99  | 16  |1 min  |
| Final digestion  | 1  |42 |1h min  |
| Enzyme inactivation | 1   |80 |15 min  |

Note: Try to use smaller vectors containing fewer inserts as reduced protein expression demands may exhibit higher transformation efficiency due to the reduced size and lower metabolic load on the cells.

## Gibson Assembly
1. PCR of all inserts & backbones to create appropriate overhangs, 
2. DpnI Digest: add 0.5 uL of DpnI to 25 uL PCR reaction, incubation 15 min at 37°C ( to remove the template DNA)
3. Gel extraction of the correct PCR products: Follow the protocol of the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel)
4. Mix 50–100 ng of vector DNA with a molar 2:1 or 1:1 ratio of each insert (see table below) 
5. Add water and NEBuilider HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix as indicated below

| Reagent  | 2-3 Fragment Assembly |4-6 Fragment Assembly |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| molar DNA ratio (vector:insert)  | 1:2  |1:1  |
| total amounts of DNA fragments  | 0.03-0.2 pmol |0.2-0.5 pmol|
| NEBuilider HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix | 2.5 μl |2.5 μl |
| ddH2O  | fill up to 5 μl |fill up to 5 μl |

Incubate samples in a thermocycler at 50°C for 60 minutes 
Store samples on ice or at –20°C for subsequent transformation



## Bacterial transformation
To test our genetically engineered constructs, we transformed them into bacteria. For single plasmid transformation, _E. coli_ cells were made chemically competent using the Mix & Go _E. coli_ Transformation Kit & Buffer Set (Zymo Research), following the manufacturer's protocol.

1. Thaw competent DH5a on ice
2. Add 1 μl of plasmid DNA or 5 uL of assembly reaction to 20-50 μl of competent cells
3. Flick the tube to mix
4. Incubate mixture on ice for 30 minutes
5. Heat shock at the bacteria at 42 °C for 30 s
6. Place on ice for 5 minutes
7. Pipette 200 µl of room temperature LB into the mixture
8. Incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes while shaking at 750 rpm
9. Warm selection plates to 37 °C in the incubator
10. Spin down bacteria and resuspend in 50 μl LB
11. Spread 50-100 μl of cells on LB agar plates containing the antibiotics for selection. When multiple antibiotics are used, use 0.6x of the standard working concentration for each antibiotic.
12. Incubate overnight at 37 °C

For co-transformations with two accessory plasmids:
1. Thaw competent S2060 cells on ice
2. pre-mix 200 ng of the two accessory plasmids in an equimolar ratio
3. Add 50 μl of competent cells
4. Continue at step 3 above

Due to the metabolic burden caused by DNA replication and protein expression, co-transformants might grow at a markedly reduced rate.

## Phage production

The production of our phages started by assembling a plasmid containing all phage genes. Our selection plasmid, containing either SIAH1/2 or unspecific enzymes but lacking essential genes for phage replication was combined with _splitC_ (Addgene #138523) and _splitD_ (Addgene #138521) plasmids using SapI Golden Gate assembly.

Day 1: Golden Gate assembly
Assemble a plasmid containing all phage genes: the selection plasmid, _splitC_ (Addgene #138523) and _splitD_ (Addgene #138521) by mixing the following components in a PCR tube


| Reagent  | Amount |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| selection plasmid  | 200 ng  |
| _SplitC_  | 100 ng |
| _SplitD_  | 100 ng |
| 10 × T4 ligase buffer  | 1 μl |
| T4 ligase  | 0.5 μl |
| Sapl1  | 0.5 μl |
| ddH2O  | fill up to 20 μl |

Incubate in the thermocycler overnight with the following program:


| Step  | Nr. of Cycles | Temperature (ºC)|Time|
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Digestion and ligation | 99  |37  |5 min  |
| Annealing | 99  | 18 |5 min  |
| Final digestion  | 1  |37 |1h min  |
| Enzyme inactivation | 1   |80 |15 min  |

Day 2: Transformation

1. Transform the assembly reaction as explained above
2. Thaw competent S2060 cells on ice
3. Add 2 µl of the ligation reaction into 50 μl of competent S2208 cells
4. Flick the tube to mix
5. Incubate mixture on ice for 30 minutes
6. Heat shock at the bacteria at 42 °C for 30 s
7. Place on ice for 5 minutes
8. Pipette 200 µl of room temperature LB into the mixture
9. Incubate at 37°C while shaking at 750 rpm until bacteria reach saturation
10 Warm selection plates to 37 °C in the incubator
11. Spin down bacteria and resuspend in 50 μl LB
12. Spread 50-100 μl of cells on LB agar plates (which antibiotic)?
13. Incubate overnight at 37 °C

Day 3: Plaque Assay to determine phage titer

1. Spin down 2 mL (9000 g, 1 min)
2. Transfer supernatant to a new tube and sterilise with a 0.22 µm filter
3. Send purified phages for Sanger sequencing with the primer oLS670
4. Determine the phage titer with a plaque assay as described below
5. Phages can be stored in the fridge for multiple months. If titer gets to low, re-grow in S2208 bacteria again

Note: it makes sense to do 2 plaque assays. The first assay is to determine if phages are produced and to estimate their amount in plaque forming units (pfu). From the first assay plate, one plaque is picked to get monoclonal phages and a second assay is performed to asses the pfu.

## Determination of phage titer by plaque assay
1. Spin down your samples at 8’000 xg for 2 min to remove bacteria and other contaminants
2. Transfer supernatant to a new tube. Phages can be stored at 4ºC for further use (note that phage titer will gradually decrease over time)
3. Dilute a saturated S2208 culture and grow it to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5
4. Pour 15 mL LB agar without antibiotics in a Petri dish and let solidify
5. Once solidified, mix 2 mL of LB and 2 mL of hot LB agar, add 1 mL of the S2208 culture, vortex quickly, and pour on top of the solidified LB agar. Let solidify for at least 30 min
6. Meanwhile, prepare a 10-fold serial dilution of your phage sample (100 to 10-7). Remember to include a phage with a known pfu/mL as a positive control
7. Add 4 µL of each dilution onto the top agar. Let the plate sit for 15-30 min before transferring it to the incubator, making sure that the drops do not merge
8. Incubate plate overnight (16-20 h) at 37ºC
9. The tier of the phage sample can be determined by the following formula: 

titer (in pfu/mL) = (# of plaques) x (dilution factor) x 100 

## Determination of phage titer by qPCR
1. Spin down your samples at 8’000 xg for 2 min to remove bacteria and other contaminants
2. Transfer supernatant to a new tube. Phages can be stored at 4ºC for further use (note that phage titer will gradually decrease over time)
3. Prepare the qPCR reaction mix as follows:


| Reagent  | Volume (µL) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| FirePol Polymerase  | 3  |
| 100 uM Forward Primer*| 0.05 |
| 100 uM Reverse Primer*| 0.05 |
| ddH2O  | 9.9 |

*oLS-1662 100 uM and oLS-1663 were used as forward and reverse primers respectively see Supplementary Table 4 for sequences.

4. In a qPCR 384-well plate, add 13 µL of qPCR reaction mix to each well, followed by 2 µL of the supernatant of each sample. Perform triplicate measurements for better results
5. Cover the plate with an adhesive seal and briefly spin down the plate 
6. Insert the plate in the qPCR machine (here, we used the LightCycler 480 II from Roche) and program the following settings: 


| Step  | Nr. of Cycles | Temperature (ºC)|Time|
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Pre-incubation | 1  |95  |12 min  |
| Denaturation | 45  |95  |15 s  |
| Annealing | 45  | 53 |30 s  |
| Elongation  | 45 |72 |10s  |

7. Set the excitation wavelength to 465 nm and the detection wavelength to 510 nm and start the protocol
8. Analyse readout with the software analysis tool “Absolute Quantification/Second Derivative Maximum”
9. Threshold cycle (CT) values, which indicate the cycle number at which the fluorescence from the amplifying DNA exceeded a predefined threshold, can be converted to PFU/mL using previously constructed standard curved. qPCR results with CT > 30 can be considered as absence of phages

## Site-directed mutagenesis for substrate degron modification
1. Prepare a reaction mix in a PCR tube as indicated here (see Report for the corresponding primers):


| Reagent  | Ammount |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 5 × Q5 Reaction Buffer | 5 µL  |
| 10 µM Forward Primer | 1.25 µL |
| 10 µM Reverse Primer  | 1.25 µL |
| pES1076 template  | 100 ng|
| Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase  | 0.25 µL|
| Nuclease-Free Water | fill up to 25 µL|

2. Gently mix the reaction and collect all liquid to the bottom of the tube by briefly spinning it, if necessary
Set the thermocycler for the following program:


| Step  | Nr. of Cycles | Temperature (ºC)|Time|
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Initial Denaturation | 1  |98  |30 s  |
| Denaturation | 30  |30  |5 s  |
| Annealing | 30  | 50-72* |20 s  |
| Elongation  | 30 |72 |20 s/kb of product  |
| Final Elongation  | 1 |72 |2 min  |

*calculate annealing temperature for your pair of primers with the NEB T<sub>m</sub> Calculator

3. Treat 1 µL of the PCR reaction with 5 µL of KLD buffer, 1 µL of the KLD Enzyme Mix, and top it with 3 µL of water
4. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min
5. Transform 2 µL of the KLD reaction into 20 µL of competent cells and plate directly in LB agar with the appropriate antibiotics without recovery

## Phage propagation assay 
1. Transform S2060 cells with the AP(s) of interest (see Transformation)
2. Dilute a saturated overnight culture of bacteria 1,000-fold into LB media supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics and grow at 37ºC to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5
3. Aliquote 1 mL of culture into a deep-well plate and infect with phages at a starting titer of 106 pfu/mL. Seal the plate with a breathable membrane.
4. Incubate the plate overnight (16-20 h) at 37ºC
5. Determine the phage titer by performing a plaque assay (see Determination of phage titer by plaque assay). To calculate fold propagation, divide the final phage titer by the starting titer

## Phage-assisted non-continuous evolution (PANCE) to generate a library of Selection Plasmids (SP)
1. To drift your selection plasmid, you will use a S2060 strain transformed with DP6 plasmid (see Transformation)
2. Dilute a saturated overnight bacteria culture in 50 mL LB with appropriate antibiotics and 100 mM glucose, and grow it to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5
3. Add arabinose to a final concentration of 40 mM. This will induce the expression of the mutagenesis machinery.
4. Immediately after, infect your culture with phages containing the SP you want to drift to a final concentration of 104 pfu/mL
5. Incubate the flask at 37ºC, shaking at 250 rpm, overnight (16-20 h)
6. The following day, determine the phage titer using qPCR (see Determination of phage titer by qPCR)
7. Initiate the next round of drift by repeating steps 2 to 6. Infect the fresh culture with the phages that propagated overnight and whose titer you determined by qPCR

## Data analysis 
### General data analysis and visualisation
Raw data and code used to analyse it are available on a public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Student-Biolab-Zurich/idec2024-data-analysis).
### Analysis of phage drift using Sanger sequencing
Data were analysed and visualised using R Statistical Software v4.4.1[^2]. Sanger sequencing result files were processed using the sangerseqR package v1.40.0[^3]. For each nucleotide position, the fraction of mutated signal was calculated as the ratio of the maximum peak amplitude for each non-called base to the total peak amplitudes within the respective base-calling window. To account for signal degradation commonly observed at the extremities of Sanger sequencing reads, only positions between 50 and 650 were considered.
